(ENG)  The function of this circuit is to charge the batteries, protect them for overvoltage, limit the current and also balance the batteries in case of more than one cell. Lithium ion or LiPo batteries are verry popular, especially with makers like us for small robots, portable devices, RC toy cars and drones and so on. But these batteries are also very sensible and dangerous. If we don’t control the process of charging and discharging of such batteries, they will stop working or worse. The battery cells can swell and even explode from overcharging, and a deep discharge can make the battery fail. That’s why these batteries should go together with a battery management system unit or BMS. This will control the voltage and current from the battery and keep them safe. Usually, the nominal voltage of a LIPO battery is 3.8 volts and 4.2V when fully charged. As soon as the battery cell will reach this value, the charging process should stop and that’s what this circuit should do.  When we have only one cell, we only care about the maximum voltage and the current limit to protect the battery. But when we have a battery pack of more than 1 cell, so 2S, 3S and so on, we also need to balance the value of each individual cell. We have a PNP transistor connected in series with 4 diodes that will simulate a load. At the base of the transistor, we have a ZENNER reference diode (TL431) which will get open at a certain voltage value and by that connects ground to the transistors base and when the transistor is active, we bypass the battery and waste the power on the diodes instead. This ZENNER diode is the TL431 and it has a reference pin, so by adjusting the potentiometer we can set this reference to be at 4.2V, that’s how we select when the charging process will stop. I supply it with 4.2V from my power supply. I connect my multimeter at the output and using the potentiometer, we first fix the threshold value to around 4.16V, some value below 4.2V. I will use a battery which is discharged and below 4.2V (it was 3.8V). When I connect it to the charger, the LED is turned off. We have a current flow of around 450 mA and the battery is getting charged up. After some time, when we get above 4.16V the LED will turn ON so the charging process is complete. Current is now flowing through the diodes and transistor and we skip the battery, so the cell is protected for over voltage. I measure battery and it is 4.11 volts. We can take this simple circuit and merge it in series other identical circuits. With this circuit, we can charge a 3S battery for example and all individual cells will stop charging at 4.2V. The only downside, is the efficiency and heat dissipation.

Die Funktion dieses Schaltkreises besteht darin, die Batterien zu laden, sie vor Überspannung zu schützen, den Strom zu begrenzen und die Batterien bei mehr als einer Zelle auszugleichen. Lithium-Ionen- oder LiPo-Batterien sind sehr beliebt, besonders bei Machern wie uns für kleine Roboter, tragbare Geräte, ferngesteuerte Spielzeugautos und Drohnen und so weiter. Aber diese Batterien sind auch sehr empfindlich und gefährlich.
