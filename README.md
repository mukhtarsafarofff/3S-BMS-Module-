 The function of this circuit is to charge the batteries, protect them for overvoltage, limit the current and also balance the batteries in case of more than one cell. Lithium ion or LiPo batteries are verry popular, especially with makers like us for small robots, portable devices, RC toy cars and drones and so on. But these batteries are also very sensible and dangerous. If you donâ€™t control the process of charging and discharging of such batteries, they will stop working or worse.
