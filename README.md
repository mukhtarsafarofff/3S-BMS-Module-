 The function of this circuit is to charge the batteries, protect them for overvoltage, limit the current and also balance the batteries in case of more than one cell. Lithium ion or LiPo batteries are verry popular, especially with makers like us for small robots, portable devices, RC toy cars and drones and so on. But these batteries are also very sensible and dangerous. If we don’t control the process of charging and discharging of such batteries, they will stop working or worse. The battery cells can swell and even explode from overcharging, and a deep discharge can make the battery fail. That’s why these batteries should go together with a battery management system unit or BMS. This will control the voltage and current from the battery and keep them safe. Usually, the nominal voltage of a LIPO battery is 3.8 volts and 4.2V when fully charged. As soon as the battery cell will reach this value, the charging process should stop and that’s what this circuit should do.  When we have only one cell, we
 only care about the maximum voltage and the current limit to protect the battery.
